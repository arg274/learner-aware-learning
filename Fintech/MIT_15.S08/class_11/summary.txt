Professor Gary Gensler's lecture on the coronavirus crisis and its financial and economic impacts covers several key areas:

1. **Introduction to the Crisis**: The lecture starts by highlighting the dual nature of the crisis as both a healthcare and economic issue, drawing attention to its relevance. Gensler plans to discuss past financial crises, focusing on 2008, and review economic forecasts from May 2020.

2. **Impact of the Crisis**:
   - **Risk Management**: The critical role of financial services in managing and transferring economic risks.
   - **Volatility**: The positive and negative impacts of volatility on financial stability.
   - **Asset Management**: A decrease in the value of assets under management by firms like BlackRock.
   - **Revaluation of Assets**: Significant revaluations in loan portfolios due to anticipated delinquencies and defaults.
   - **Investment Shift**: Slower venture capital funding and advice for startups to focus on core operations and cash flow positivity.
   - **Commodities Investment**: A trend towards commodities investment in financial services.
   - **Oil Industry**: Reduced demand causing significant declines in oil prices and permanent shutdowns of oil valves, suggesting potential long-term changes in the energy sector.

3. **Fintech and Investment Trends**:
   - **Rise of Fintech**: The rise of fintech and its impact on the market, noting that many fintech firms are not currently profitable but are expected to gain market share post-pandemic.
   - **Venture Capital**: Slower venture capital funding and cautious investment strategies.
   - **IPO Delays**: Likely delays in initial public offerings for the remainder of 2020 and possibly into 2021.
   - **Startups and Consolidation**: Increased consolidation across different sectors, with successful fintech startups relying on strong revenue models and user adoption.

4. **Economic and Technological Trends**:
   - **US Federal Reserve**: Continues to issue paper money at a steady pace.
   - **Technology Adoption**: Significant trend towards the wide acceptance of new technologies, particularly mobile phones and mobile delivery interfaces.
   - **Large Data Pools**: Increasingly valuable large data pools.
   - **Big Finance**: Handles large volumes in capital and government debt markets and is involved in stimulus loan programs.
   - **Loan Loss Reserves**: Bolstered loan loss reserves with potential significant delinquencies expected in various sectors, particularly the corporate and leveraged loan markets.

5. **US Dollar Stability**: During crises, there is a "flight to quality," making the US dollar a preferred currency, predicted to remain dominant for multiple decades unless China significantly changes its economic policies.

6. **Global Economic Context**:
   - **Housing Market Asset Bubble**: Global impact, particularly its spread beyond the U.S. to countries like Spain and Europe.
   - **Fiscal Stimulus and Loans**: Fintech startups assisting small businesses with applying for PPP loans, some issuing forgivable loans instead of receiving them.

7. **Fintech Company Challenges**:
   - **Delinquencies and Defaults**: Increased risk of delinquencies and defaults, especially in consumer and small business lending.
   - **Interest Rate Fluctuations**: Businesses with models dependent on interest rate fluctuations should consider the impact of decreasing rates.
   - **Subsector Analysis**: Payments are relatively stable, unsecured personal lending is risky, and infrastructure lending may remain unaffected.

Overall, the lecture emphasizes the need for strategic and tactical approaches to navigate the challenges posed by the crisis, with a focus on understanding and mitigating risks in each sector.
