Professionalism & Academic Integrity

Success goes to those Prepared, Curious & Self Starters
Respect & Courtesy builds Reputations, Networks & Trust
Learning comes best to those who Listen as well as Talk
Understanding Strategy and Paying Attention to Details both Matter
Staying True to your Values is the best alternative

Avoiding Plagiarism is not just an Academic Integrity Policy

It protects one’s Grade, Job and Reputation

Be attentive, speak in class, keep your video on, and audio muted unless speaking
Proper attribution of quotes and paraphrasing is required 28
